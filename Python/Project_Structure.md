## Description of Components

### Jupyter Notebooks
- `Harold-Python提交.ipynb` - Original Python submission notebook
- `Harold-Python提交(no image).ipynb` - Python submission without images version
- `Python笔记及课后习题.ipynb` - Python notes and homework exercises (in Chinese)
- `test.ipynb` - Test notebook for experimentation
- `.ipynb_checkpoints\` - Auto-generated checkpoint files from Jupyter

### CS61A Course Materials
This directory contains materials for the CS61A course (likely Berkeley's Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, adapted for Python):

- `hw\` - Homework assignments (currently containing hw01, hw02, hw03)
- `lab\` - Laboratory assignments (currently containing lab00 through lab03)
- `projects\` - Course projects directory (currently empty)

### Test Directory
- `test\bubble_sort.py` - Implementation of bubble sort algorithm with both basic and optimized versions
- Contains a complete implementation with examples and tests

### Other Files
- `test.py` - A Python script file, possibly for testing

## Educational Focus
This project appears to be dedicated to Python programming education, with a focus on:
- Core programming concepts
- Algorithms (demonstrated by the bubble sort implementation)
- Coursework from CS61A
- Practical exercises and problem solving
